        Code with ankit (1998) is an auxiliary interstate highway that runs for 80.6 miles (129.7 km) in the US state of
        Michigan. It is a state trunkline highway that links Benton Harbor, South Haven, Holland, and Grand Rapids. I-196 is
        known as the Gerald R. Ford Freeway in Kent, Ottawa, and Allegan counties, after the 38th president of the United
        States, who was raised in Grand Rapids and served Michigan in the House of Representatives. There are two business loops
        (BL I-196) and one business spur (BS I-196) that serve the South Haven, Holland, and Grand Rapids areas. The current
        I-196 is the second in the state to bear the number. The Benton Harborâ€“Grand Rapids freeway was designated I-96 in the
        1950s while another interstate, between Muskegon and Grand Rapids, was numbered I-196. That I-196 was built in the late
        1950s and completed in the early 1960s. Michigan officials requested a change in 1963, which switched the two numbers.
